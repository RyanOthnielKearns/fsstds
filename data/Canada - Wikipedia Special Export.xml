'''Canada''' is a country in [[North America]]. Its [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]] extend from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and northward into the [[Arctic Ocean]], covering {{convert|9.98|e6km2|e6sqmi|2|abbr=off}}, making it the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by area|second-largest country by total area]]. Its southern and western [[Canadaâ€“United States border|border with the United States]], stretching {{convert|8891|km|mi}}, is the world's longest bi-national land border. Canada's capital is [[Ottawa]], and its three [[List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada|largest metropolitan areas]] are [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]], and [[Vancouver]].

[[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous peoples]] have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. Beginning in the 16th century, [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of [[Military history of Canada|various armed conflicts]], France [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|ceded nearly all]] of [[New France|its colonies in North America]] in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three [[British North America]]n colonies through [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], Canada was formed as a [[Federalism|federal]] [[dominion]] of four provinces. This began an [[Territorial evolution of Canada|accretion of provinces and territories]] and a process of increasing autonomy from the [[United Kingdom]]. This widening autonomy was highlighted by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] and culminated in the [[Canada Act 1982]], which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].

Canada is a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] in the [[Westminster system|Westminster tradition]]. The country's [[head of government]] is the [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]]â€”who holds office by virtue of their ability to [[Confidence and supply|command the confidence]] of the elected [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]â€”and is appointed by the [[Governor General of Canada|governor general]], representing the [[Monarchy of Canada|monarch]], who serves as [[head of state]]. The country is a [[Commonwealth realm]] and is [[Official bilingualism in Canada|officially bilingual]] at the federal level. It [[International rankings of Canada|ranks among the highest]] in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, [[economic freedom]], and education. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and [[Multiculturalism in Canada|multicultural]] nations, the product of [[Immigration to Canada|large-scale immigration]] from many other countries. Canada's [[Canadaâ€“United States relations|long and complex relationship with the United States]] has had a significant impact on [[Economy of Canada|its economy]] and [[Culture of Canada|culture]].

A highly [[developed country]], Canada has the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|24th highest nominal per-capita income globally]] and the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|sixteenth-highest]] ranking in the [[Human Development Index]]. Its advanced economy is the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|ninth-largest in the world]], relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada is part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], the [[Group of Seven|G7]], the [[Group of Ten (economics)|Group of Ten]], the [[G20]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[Arctic Council]], the {{Lang|fr|[[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]]}}, the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] forum, and the [[Organization of American States]].

==Etymology==
&lt;!--linked--&gt;
{{Main|Name of Canada}}&lt;!--Please see the talk page before editing this to specify which languages produced the word Canada. There are differences of opinion, which may be best discussed at Name of Canada--&gt;
While a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of ''Canada'', the name is now accepted as coming from the [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians|St. Lawrence Iroquoian]] word {{lang|lre|kanata}}, meaning "village" or "settlement".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Olson |first1=James Stuart |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyqepNdgUWkC&amp;pg=PA109 |title=Historical Dictionary of European Imperialism |last2=Shadle |first2=Robert |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-313-26257-9 |page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1535, Indigenous inhabitants of the present-day [[Quebec City]] region used the word to direct French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]] to the village of [[Stadacona]].&lt;ref name="Rayburn2001"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rayburn |first=Alan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aiUZMOypNB4C&amp;pg=PA14 |title=Naming Canada: Stories about Canadian Place Names |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8020-8293-0 |pages=14â€“22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartier later used the word ''Canada'' to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to [[Donnacona]] (the chief at Stadacona);&lt;ref name="Rayburn2001" /&gt; by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the [[Saint Lawrence River]] as ''Canada''.&lt;ref name="Rayburn2001" /&gt;

From the 16th to the early 18th century, "[[Canada (New France)|Canada]]" referred to the part of [[New France]] that lay along the Saint Lawrence River.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Magocsi |first=Paul R. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dbUuX0mnvQMC&amp;pg=PA1048 |title=Encyclopedia of Canada's Peoples |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-8020-2938-6 |page=1048}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1791, the area became two British colonies called [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]]. These two colonies were collectively named [[the Canadas]] until their union as the British [[Province of Canada]] in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=1841 |title=An Act to Re-write the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, and for the Government of Canada |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BCQtAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA20 |publisher=J.C.

Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the ''[[Canada Health Act]]''; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. [[Equalization payments]] are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Clemens |first1=Jason |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yc6RakXxLy0C&amp;pg=PA8 |title=Beyond Equalization: Examining Fiscal Transfers in a Broader Context |last2=Veldhuis |first2=Niels |publisher=[[Fraser Institute]] |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-88975-215-3 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
